# SEG and SR for NLSTSeg

This repository performs a conversion of the NLSTSeg tumor segmentations to DICOM Segmentation format. Additionally, we extract shape and first-order features, and save them in DICOM Structured Reports. 

We provide a [Google Colaboratory notebook](https://github.com/deepakri201/SEG_and_SR_for_NLSTSeg/blob/main/SEG_and_SR_for_NLSTSeg.ipynb) for the conversion.
